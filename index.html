    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <p>I am a Bachelor of Cybersecurity student, currently pursuing my degree from the University of Technology Sydney (UTS). 
        During my school years, I was fortunate enough to be a recipient of the Chief Minister's Peace in the Pacific Study Tour (Northern Territory, Australia).
        I am currently working as a retail team member at JB Hi-Fi, primarily as a salesperson where I deliver excellent customer service through
        deep product and service knowledge.
        As a penultimate year student, I am now pursuing my passion for cybersecurity and apply my skills and knowledge to real-world projects
        that I have gained throughout my academics journey.
