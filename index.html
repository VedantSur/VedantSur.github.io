<h2 class="Header">My Story</h2>

<h3 class="first-sent">
    Welcome! My name is <span class="highlight">Vedant Surjan</span>.
</h3>
    
<p> Ever since my family got their first smartphone, I've been fascinated by how it worked and its ability to do so much in such a small form factor. 
    
    This curiosity led me to explore and experiment with any tech gadgets that found its way into my hands. 
    
    I continued down this path of wanting to learn everything about everything, and asking the never-ending "why" questions, so much that I was awarded "The Most Curious Student" in school.
</p>
    
<p>
    Growing up in arguably the most technologically advanced city in the world (Tokyo), I channeled my interests into understanding not just how technology works but how it has transformed and improved our lives. 
    
    This eventually evolved into a passion for the tech industry, specifically focusing on devices and tools that have transformed lives for the better. 
    
    Today, I am in my final year of a <span class="highlight">Bachelor of Cybersecurity</span> at the <span class="highlight">University of Technology Sydney</span> (UTS).
</p>

<p>
    Outisde of my studies and work, I enjoy staying up-to-date on the latest news in the cybersecurity space and exploring emerging technologies. 
    
    Being passionate about learning, I use my curiosity to expand and build my knowledge about anything - not kidding! 
    
    When I'm not exploring tech, I enjoy spending quality time with friends and family, casual gaming, playing sports and the occasional adventure!
